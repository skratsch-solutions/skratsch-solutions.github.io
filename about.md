## Our Commitment

Similar to doctors or attorneys, our role is to prioritize your best interests. While we do have preferences, we don't adhere to vendor quotas.

We earn your trust by:

- Remaining neutral and objective, always prioritizing your needs
- Focusing on our technical expertise and transparently acknowledging when a project falls outside our skill set
- Delivering on our promises

Our word is our bond. If we commit to something, we follow through. If issues arise, we take corrective action. Trust is at the core of our approach.

## Our Approach

At Skratsh Solutions, we adhere to a simple philosophy: treat our clients the way we want to be treated. We don't believe in upgrading just because a software vendor releases a new version. Instead, we help you prioritize and plan ahead, especially when finances are tight. Our technology consulting team boasts certifications from Apple, Microsoft, and other leading software companies. Plus, we communicate in plain English and recommend solutions that align with your technology comfort level.

## Our Valued Clients

We pride ourselves on being a small business too. Our clients appreciate our responsiveness and personalized approach. Here's what our typical customers look like:

- They employ 5 to 100 staff members.
- In-house IT support isn't their forte.
- They handle significant data, systems, and paperwork.
- They recognize the need for more efficient solutions.

While many of our clients are based in South Michigan - specifically Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne Counties - we also provide remote technology consulting services to companies across the state. Even if you're out-of-state, we're here to assist you, whether remotely or on-site.

## The Final Stretch

“Final Stretch,” refers to the last 20% of the journey when it comes to providing services to small and mid-sized businesses. Imagine that the process of finding suitable software is like running a race. The first 80% involves researching, evaluating options, and making initial decisions. However, that last 20% - the final stretch - can be tricky. It’s where businesses often encounter challenges such as integrating different software tools seamlessly. Just like stitching together a patchwork quilt, this phase requires careful attention to ensure that all the pieces fit together harmoniously. So, in essence, it’s about completing the puzzle and making sure your software solutions work cohesively.
