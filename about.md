## Our Promise

Like a doctor or an attorney, our job is to look out for your best interests. Sure, we have our favorite brands, but we don't have vendor quotas to meet.

We work to earn your trust every day by:

* Staying neutral and objective, putting your needs first
* Focusing on our areas of technical expertise - and telling you when a project is outside of our skill sets
* Doing what we say we'll do

Our word is our bond. If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If something goes wrong, we make it right. We put our words into action.

## Our Philosophy

We treat our clients like we want to be treated. We don't believe you have to upgrade just because the software vendor puts out a new release.

When money is tight, we will help you prioritize and plan ahead to stretch your technology budget. Our technology consulting team hold certifications from Apple, Microsoft and from other software companies as well.

We speak plain English, and recommend solutions that fit your technology comfort level.

## Our Clients

Our clients tell us they like working with us because we're also a small business, and are responsive to their needs. Our customers typically:

* Have 5-100 employees
* Dont usually have a dedicated in-house IT support team
* Are managing lots of data, systems and paper
* Know there must be a better way!

Many of our customers are located in South Michigan - Macomb, Oakland & Wayne Counties - but we also do remote technology consulting work for companies who are out in other parts of the state as well. Out-of-state? We can still help, remotely or on-site if you choose.

## The Last 20%

It's tempting for small business owners, and even mid-sized business executives, to go on a never-ending hunt for the perfect set of software solutions, ending up with a patchwork quilt of software - that's never been sewn together.
