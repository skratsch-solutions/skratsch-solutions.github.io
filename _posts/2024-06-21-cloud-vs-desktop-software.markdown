Which small business software is right for you? One of the most
fundamental options you face today is whether to buy a cloud solution or
a on-premise solution. For this article, I wanted to share the pros and
cons of each option so you can decide your own winner of cloud vs
desktop software.

## Cloud vs Desktop software

|  | Cloud-based Software | **Desktop Software** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | With the cloud, you are perpetually “renting” access to your software. <br>You pay a smaller amount on a monthly or annual basis, but over time,<br>you may end up spending more than if you had just purchased the<br>software. | You pay in full up-front for the cost of the software. You often<br>then receive updates until the next version is released, and then you<br>pay for the upgrade. |
| **Functionality** | Feature may differ. Requires analyzing the areas most important to<br>you. Even the same software program, like “QuickBooks Pro and QuickBooks<br>Online” may have differences between their online and desktop<br>functionality. | Feature may differ. Requires analyzing the areas most important to<br>you. |
| **Availability** | Software can typically be accessed from any website browser. However,<br>when you don’t have an Internet connection, you usually won’t be able to<br>use the software. | You may be able to access your software remotely through a [VPN connection](/security/setup-small-business-vpn).<br>Otherwise, you’ll have to be in the same physical location as the<br>software to use the software. |
| **Security** | Any information stored on the web can be vulnerable to hackers.<br>However, most cloud providers have instituted multiple levels of<br>security to prevent intrusions. | Information stored on a local desktop or server must be backed up to<br>multiple locations and stored off site. Otherwise, you could lose all<br>your data due to fire, flood or theft. |
| **Administration** | The cloud software provider provides all the infrastructure. They<br>take care of security, backups, patches, and upgrades. | You’ll need an IT resource to manage the IT environment, manage<br>upgrades, and create policies for rolling out new versions of the<br>software. |

Many small businesses are moving toward [cloud-based software](/software/evaluating-saas-solutions-small-biz) due to its
affordability, ease of use, lower IT administration costs, and
convenience with the new normal of the hybrid workforce. But every
software solution is slightly different.
