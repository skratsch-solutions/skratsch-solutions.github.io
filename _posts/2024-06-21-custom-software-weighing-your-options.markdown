At this point, you've looked for standard commercial off-the-shelf
software (COTS) and you can't find software that does what you need. You
don't want to adjust your processes so you can use a standard software
program. Those processes make your business unique or more efficient.

You don't have to be a major corporation to choose custom software
development. Many small to medium businesses (SMBs) use custom
programming to:

-   Connect different software applications
-   Add functionality to a software program
-   Automate repetitive features
-   Consolidate data for better insights

## Examples of custom software development

### The burger button

The next time you go to a fast-food chain, notice that workers have
"burger buttons" to enter your order quickly. The point-of-sale software
knows exactly what goes into each menu item. If the customer wants to
customize their order (no onions) or take advantage of a bundled
offering (burger, fries & a soda), the worker has additional buttons to
quickly customize each item. The burger button custom programming
enables the restaurant to:

-   Serve more customers in less time, which serves as a business
    differentiator
-   Make fewer mistakes, which builds trust with customers
-   Spend less time training workers, which cuts down on payroll costs

### Small business examples

**For Quoting:** A cleaning or installation company might want to
capture square footage of each room to create a quote

**For Proof:** A rental company might want to have a custom inspection
form with before/after pictures to be stored with the customer and asset
records.

**For Insight:** A service company may want to send a survey out to
customers after each visit, and calculate satisfaction scores by service
or by technician.

## Is custom software a good fit for your situation?

If you come to us and ask us for a custom software quote, the first
thing we'll do is schedule a free ["Explore the possibilities" call](/explore) to
determine if your project is a good fit for custom software.

1.  What are you trying to accomplish? How are we creating something
    that's different from solutions out in the marketplace today?
2.  What's the rest of your technical environment look like? If we need
    to integrate with existing software, do we understand what that
    looks like?
3.  Are your expectations reasonable? Are the project budget and
    timeline in line with your expectations?
4.  Who internally will manage the project? What type of support do you
    need after the project is complete?

Through our discussions, our goal is to help you understand the
tradeoffs that come with custom software so you can make an educated
decision about how to proceed with your project.

## Calculating the rewards of custom software

Since all variables aren't known at the beginning of a software
development project, calculating your return on investment (ROI) will be
an educated guess.

For financial rewards, you can look at:

-   **Time Savings** (Estimated Time Saved) X (# of users) X (pay rate)
    = BENEFIT / (Cost of Software)
-   **More Revenue** (Additional revenue potential) / (Cost of Software
    Development)

For non-financial rewards, many organizations take into account:

-   How many additional people they can serve (non-profits)
-   Boosted employee morale or customer loyalty
-   Accomplishing something that would be extremely difficult /
    impossible to do without software

### Minimizing the risks of custom software

**1. Be actively engaged in the software development process.** Assign
an internal project manager if possible. Make sure key players have
enough time be deeply involved with the project. Your team needs to be
involved in the testing process and be available to clarify
instructions. Most breakdowns in the software development process come
down to miscommunications between the business and software development
teams. For example, a client may assume that the software will check an
applicant's age or validate that the birthday is entered in a certain
format, but neither will happen unless those items are specified. Having
team members readily available reduces the risk of unspoken assumptions
and conflicting instructions.

**2. Understand that if you change the project requirements, the project budget and timeline will also change.** Recognize that good ideas are
normal, but that they come with associated costs. The phrase "as long as
we're doing X, we may as well do Y" is a clue that your project is
expanding.

A good parallel is to think about is hiring a contractor to remodel your
kitchen. If you decide to do the adjacent bathroom at the same time, the
overall price and timeline of the project will increase, but still
probably be less expensive than doing the bathroom as a separate project
later. Like remodeling an older home, in software development, you want
to plan for the unexpected.

**3. Custom software is never one-and-done.** Create a plan for ongoing
support and maintenance of your software, either internally or with your
software development team.

**4. Minimize the number of connected software applications** Or at
least recognize that every connection point comes with the risk that
something will change and the connector may break or work improperly.
Even major technology companies like Microsoft make changes that
inadvertently cause problems for connected applications.

**5. Work with your software development company.** Build a
relationship. With any service, things can go wrong. How the project
team handles these bumps in the road makes all the difference in the
project outcome.
