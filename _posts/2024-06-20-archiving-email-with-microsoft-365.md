In the digital age, our inboxes are often inundated with emails, leading to clutter and decreased productivity. To maintain an organized inbox and ensure no important communication is lost, regular email archiving is essential.

## What is Email Archiving?

Email archiving is the practice of transferring emails from your primary inbox to a separate archive folder. This process helps in decluttering your inbox while keeping your emails accessible for future reference.

## Evolution of Email Archiving

Previously, archived emails were stored locally on your hard drive as an Outlook .PST file. This method posed risks of data loss due to hardware issues. Today, cloud-based archiving is the preferred method, offering enhanced security and accessibility.

## Personal Email Archiving Options

- **Quick Archive Feature**: Microsoft 365's Outlook Web App includes a convenient 'Archive' button that swiftly moves emails to an Archive folder within your mailbox.
- **Personal Archive Policies**: Set up policies to automatically move emails to a local PST file or cloud storage, freeing up mailbox space and keeping your emails searchable.

## Organizational Email Archiving Strategies

Microsoft 365 administrators can implement organization-wide archiving policies, ensuring a centralized and secure approach to email management.

## Advantages of Cloud-Based Archiving

- Centralized control and reduced risk of data loss
- Emails moved out of the mailbox do not count towards size limits
- Searchable archives without opening PST files
- Potential for unlimited archiving space with certain subscription plans

## Handling Emails of Departing Employees

Convert former employees' mailboxes to shared mailboxes, allowing multiple users access without the need to manage PST files.

## Archiving for Legal & Compliance

Microsoft 365 offers features to assist with compliance and retention requirements.
