According to to the [Privacy Rights Clearing House](https://www.privacyrights.org/data-breaches), over 900 MILLION records have been compromised in 7,283 public data security breaches since 2005. While that number may seem HUGE, it's actually a gross underestimation, because that figure does not include private security breaches.Â 

When big businesses have a [major data security breach](/security/cloudflare-security-breach-password-security), it makes the news. Consumers are warned to change their passwords.

> **When small businesses have a major data security breach, most will go out of business!**

(PWC reports 70% of small businesses have closed after a breach) That's largely because most small businesses don't have a data security strategy in place.

## How can you prevent data security breaches?

Understand how data security breaches happen and what you can do to avoid them happening to your small business.

### 1. Accidental Disclosure

An otherwise good employee may inadvertently post sensitive data to a social media site or in an email by accident. They may not realize that:

- Data can be easily extracted from QR codes or bar codes
- Sensitive information can be easily revealed in a different Excel tab or a hidden field
- The email thread has sensitive information below it
- They need someone's permission to post (pictures of clients or client names)

#### Fix: Clearly mark sensitive/confidential documents. Create policies about social media sharing

### 1. Hacking and Malware

Today's criminals don't need guns. They use software to gain access to your computers and servers.

#### Fix: Invest in firewalls, anti-virus software, encryption software and keep these programs up to date. Since software isn't 100% failproof, train employees to be vigilant, and not to open [suspicious emails](/security/phishing-prevention-best-practices). Don't allow guests to bring in unsecured software or hardware

### 1. Malicious Employees

Disgruntled, desperate and dishonest employees may steal information from you.

#### FIX: Conduct background checks on new employees and contractors. And include off-boarding procedures to include your sensitive data. Don't leave sensitive information laying around. Locking up information is the best way to keep people honest

### 1. Lost, discarded or stolen paper documents

Old school paper-based theft still exists. Criminals may dig through your garbage to find useful information.

#### FIX: Shred your documents. If you have too much paper to shred, hire a service like [Iron Mountain](https://www.ironmountain.com/services/secure-shredding) to do it for you

### 1. Lost, discarded or stolen electronics

Flash drives, smart phones, CDs and computers often contain sensitive information.

#### FIX: Protect your laptops and mobile devices and be careful where you use them. [VPN software](/security/setup-small-business-vpn) can provide more security than a public WIFI. Keep information encrypted with [secure, changing passwords](/security/password-security-best-practices). Before you discard hardware, wipe it clean.

A reputable [IT Services company](/it-services) can make sure you have adequate [data security](/security/disaster-recovery-planning-lessons) measures in place, that your firewall and backups have been tested, and that you have the proper [IT policies and procedures](/consulting/it-policies-and-procedures) in place. Preventing a problem is WAY less expensive than fixing one.
