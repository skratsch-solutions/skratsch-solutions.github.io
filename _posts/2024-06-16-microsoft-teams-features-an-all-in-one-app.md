Microsoft Teams has evolved as a comprehensive app within Microsoft 365, replacing Skype for Business and enhancing collaboration with features like SharePoint, OneNote, and Planner. It's a versatile platform that allows for the integration of various desktop apps, ensuring enterprise-level security to safeguard your data against cyber threats and breaches.

## Teamwork Made Easy

Teams are at the heart of Microsoft Teams, allowing for the creation of organization-wide, departmental, and project teams, which can include both internal and external users based on your security preferences. Channels within teams help streamline conversations around specific projects, topics, or clients, inheriting the team's security settings.

## Key Features of Microsoft Teams:

- **Chat**: Renowned for its chat capabilities, Microsoft Teams enables you to communicate with colleagues or clients within Teams, Channels, or one-on-one. Guest users can also participate if allowed by your organization. Enhance your messages with files, stickers, gifs, or emojis, and easily convert chats into video calls or schedule meetings.
- **Video and Phone Calls**: Addressing security concerns associated with other platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams offers a secure alternative with additional features and seamless integration with Office 365 applications. Make calls to team members or external contacts, with the option to call landlines or cellphones using a Microsoft Office 365 Calling Plan.
- **Calendar**: Organize meetings without leaving Teams, thanks to the integrated scheduling assistant that helps find suitable times for all participants.
- **File Sharing**: Share any file from your computer through Teams, with SharePoint syncing natively, providing access to company files via the Files tab.
- **Applications**: With thousands of applications available, Teams can boost your team's productivity and morale with apps tailored for analytics, productivity, sales, human resources, and more.

## Embrace Microsoft Teams for Free
Microsoft is continuously investing in the development of Teams, making it available at no cost for non-Microsoft 365 users, although the full benefits are realized with Microsoft 365 integration.
