Considering buying a server for your business? Before computers became
so powerful and remote work became so popular, most businesses had at
least one physical server in their offices -- and sometimes even a
dedicated server room. 

Today, when you only have a handful of employees, it's easy enough to
share folders and files on a few PCs. But as your business grows,
security, speed and reliability become more important. That's often when
it makes sense to invest in business servers. 

## Is it time to buy a server?

Here are a few questions we ask our clients when they're experiencing
business growth and considering expanding their network environment:

-   What are your business goals for buying a server?
-   Are you running low on file storage or anticipate a need for more
    drive space?
-   Are you in need of application servers or a database server to run
    business applications?
-   Have your workload requirements increased?
-   Do you need more computing power or more disk storage than you have
    today?
-   Are you looking for better backup and recovery processes?
-   Are you concerned about client confidentiality and sensitive data
    access?
-   Do you have compliance / governance needs?

The more of these that you answer **YES** to, the more benefit you'll
get from buying a server.

## What are the benefits of buying a server?

Servers are built to be faster and more reliable than PCs, but
primarily, they help you enforce IT policies and run your business more
smoothly with:

-   Better [data security with     more](/security/prevent-data-security-breaches) granular levels of access
-   Consistent [backups with lower routine     maintenance](/it-services/backup-and-recovery-services) costs
-   Company-wide patches and upgrades
-   Corporate-level access permissions

## 5 Factors to consider when buying a server

1.  **Price**. We don't know many companies with an unlimited budget.
    Physical servers start at about \$2000 and can go up significantly
    from there, depending on the specifications. That price doesn't
    include additional hardware components, power usage, or floor space
    needed -- that's just the initial cost for an entry level server.
    Business owners must also consider costs for power, maintenance
    costs, and other long-term costs. It's important to factor in the
    total cost of ownership instead of looking at just the upfront cost.
    We recommend finding a server that will meet your needs for the next
    3-5 years, without overspending on features you don't really need.
    Of course, if you choose a cloud-based server instead, you'll avoid
    most of these upfront costs for server hardware and software. Those
    costs are bundled into the cloud services.
2.  **Features**. Before you buy your first server, know what the server
    will be used for: File storage? E-mail services? To manage lots of
    user queries? That will help us create hardware specifications that
    define how much memory[ and hard drive     space](/business/common-mistakes-when-buying-computers) is
    needed. You'll also want to make sure you have an operating system
    (OS) that's compatible with your network environment and with the
    software applications you intend to use. While we can't make blanket
    recommendations in an article, we can recommend you request a
    [Server Assessment](/explore).  If you need to run
    multiple operating systems, you may consider using virtual machines
    or virtual servers on top of your servers. **See our article about
    [virtual servers](/business/physical-vs-virtual-servers-what-why-how) for more information.**
3.  **Reliability and availability of cloud servers.** Rather than
    having hardware on-site in your office, many businesses are opting
    for cloud servers[ hosted on Azure or     Amazon](/it-services/cloud-migration-services).
    These servers work similarly to an on premises server, but you rent
    the server instead of owning it, and the cloud hosting provider
    promises to virtually eliminate server downtime. They take care of
    everything at the hardware level, but you still manage the software
    and all the applications inside of the box.
4.  **Maintenance plans.** Just like regular computers, servers need to
    be regularly updated, monitored and maintained. Even if you choose
    to go with a virtual server, you're responsible for maintaining
    everything within the server walls -- the software, databases, etc.
    Most companies choose to outsource this work to [technology     consulting companies](/it-services) (like ourselves)
    rather than hiring IT staff.
5.  **Warranty / Service Level Agreement**. If you buy server hardware,
    we recommend you get the 3-year extended warranty in case anything
    goes wrong. Cloud hosting providers provide uptime guarantee as part
    of their service level agreement. 

## Need help buying your first server?

Our [staff of IT professionals](/business/outsourced-it-services-provider-benefits) are happy to help. A server evaluation usually takes
about an hour of billable time, which (of course) varies based on the
complexity of your business. That's not much -- *especially* when you
consider that there's NO obligation to buy the server from us or to use
our services.

We continually hear from companies how either they wish they would have
asked us first because they "got sold" way more technology than they
needed, or they bought a server that didn't meet their needs at all and
then couldn't return it.

We prefer happy customer stories when the customer is delighted they
called us, and how we saved them time, money and endless headaches down
the road.

you need, contact us today.
