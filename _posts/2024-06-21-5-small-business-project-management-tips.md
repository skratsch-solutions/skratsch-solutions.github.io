Small businesses don't have time to waste. Unfocused meetings and
tedious follow up on projects can drain your energy and your bank
account. How do you regain control without micro-managing your team?
Typically, the problem isn't the project planning, it's in the follow
up. Having the right small business project management tools is
critical.

To keep your team on track, we put together our 5 best small business
project management tips and tools.

## Small business project management tips

### 1. Use a file sharing site

Stop sending documents back and forth via email. Store your documents in
one central location like the cloud. Project files can be stored on a
cloud file storage site like:

-   [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
-   [Box](https://www.box.com/)
-   [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)
-   [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/)

### 2. Use small business project management software

Today, there are dozens of affordable cloud-based [small business
software](/software/small-business-software-work-efficiently)
project management tools to choose from. Some of the more popular ones
include:

-   [Asana for Gmail users](https://asana.com/)
-   [Teamwork Project Management Software](https://www.teamwork.com/)
-   [Insightly CRM and Project Management](https://www.insightly.com/)
-   [Trello Card-Style Project Management](https://trello.com/)
-   [Basecamp Project Management](https://basecamp.com/)
-   [Clickup Project Management](https://dapulse.com/)

Your project management can often link to the files you have stored on
your file sharing site. Using the right project management software for
communications will reduce the back-and-forth of trying to find the most
recent version of "that one document" and sifting through hundreds of
email messages to try to remember what was said and who is responsible.

### 3. Share your calendar

Both [Google G-Suite and Office
365](/business/google-workspace-vs-microsoft-365) allow you to share
your calendar with others in your office, or even to publish your
calendar online. You can create custom calendars for business areas,
like the Marketing and Tradeshow calendar or the Conference Room 1
Resource calendar. You can also subscribe to internet calendars, and
even bring in the project management calendars mentioned above.

To streamline your home/work life, you can create a separate calendar
for personal obligations. The beauty of having multiple calendars is
that you can see all your commitment in one place, and selectively share
your availability with your team. You can then access your calendar via
your phone, iPad or other device.

### 4. Create workflow.

Document your process. Once you have everything "set" like you want it
to be, use automation tools like [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/)
,[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) (if this then that),
[Zapier](https://zapier.com/)Â and even [Outlook Tasks](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-tasks-and-to-do-items-45a94e7b-a4ee-46ea-9823-c3423c0eab8e)
 or [Boomerang for Outlook](http://www.boomerangoutlook.com/)
 to remind you of overdue tasks.
People will be amazed how on top of things you are when you use
technology instead of your memory to keep projects moving forward. If
you keep thinking, "[There has to be a better
way!](/software/small-business-software-work-efficiently)" ...there
probably is!

### 5. Use chat and online meeting tools

There's nothing more frustrating than needing "just one quick answer" to
finalize a project.... Except maybe having someone commandeer 30 minutes
of your time for "one quick question."

Get your entire team committed to using an instant messaging tool like [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to get answers quickly. Instead of meeting face-to-face, schedule online conferences where you can share your screen, and even record the session for people who couldn't participate.

Popular online meeting software includes:

-   [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)
-   [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)
-   [Go to Meeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com/)
-   [Skype for Business](https://www.skype.com/en/business/skype-for-business/)
-   [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

Your business success largely depends on your ability to manage projects
efficiently to completion. As a leader in your company, your job is to
get everyone on the same page, enthusiastic about the mission at hand,
and provide employees with the project management tools to do their jobs
efficiently. We hope these small business project management tips and
tools have been helpful.
