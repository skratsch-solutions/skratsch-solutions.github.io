Now it's time to find a software development company. You probably get
solicitations all the time from offshore programmers offering to build
whatever you need for almost nothing. If only it were that simple! Most
custom software is not something that can be delegated so easily. You
need to consider: 

-   **Trustworthiness** -- Do you trust them with network access?
-   **Legal recourse** -- What happens if they never deliver?
-   **Support** -- Will they be around to fix things?

On the other side of the coin, you can hire a big management consulting
firm. They will likely do a great job, but at a significant price tag.
If you're a normal small-to-midsize business, how do you find a "right
sized" software development firm? Read on to find out.

## 5 Factors for choosing the right software development company

Personality fit goes at the top of the list because it is the most
overlooked factor, and I'd argue one of the most important
considerations in looking for a software developer. This doesn't mean
that you and your development team have to be best friends, it means
that you have a similar communication style.

-   Do you have trust and rapport?
-   Do you understand what the other person is saying?
-   Do you feel comfortable asking clarifying questions?

### 2. Project size and structure fit

When you select a software development team, you want your project to be
"right sized." A big software developer is going to have multiple people
working at once -- project management, business analysts, programmers,
quality assurance and testing -- and your invoices will reflect this
level of effort. Other considerations are: 

-   When and how often will you be invoiced?
-   Are you in agreement about how changes are approved? Can changes be
    approved over the phone or do you require written, signed documents?
-   What is the cadence of the project? Are your expectations of the
    time commitments and deliverables aligned?

### 3. Solution fit

You'll want your custom software to fit into your tech stack. However,
that doesn't always mean that you need .NET or the Power Platform just
because you're a Microsoft-centric organization.  We regularly use open
source solutions like
[Django](/software/using-django-with-sql-server-localdb) and Wagtail to replace Microsoft Access databases.  

-   Is the tech stack (database, programming language, etc.) well
    supported?
-   Will this solution fit into the rest of my IT environment?
-   How cost effective is this solution compared to alternatives?

### 4. Skills fit

The only way to really assess the skills of a software development team
is to see what else they've done. And because they may be bound by
non-disclosure agreements, these projects may not be listed on their
website. Ask the software developers for references and examples of past
projects.  

-   Are the projects similar in size and scope?
-   Has this team tackled projects with similar goals?
-   Is the interface of the finished product aligned with your
    expectations?

### 5. Support fit

Once the software has been delivered, it still needs to be supported and
enhanced either in-house or by the software development team.  

-   What type of ongoing maintenance and support is offered after
    delivery?
-   How is support billed?
-   Do we require round-the-clock or non-English language support?
