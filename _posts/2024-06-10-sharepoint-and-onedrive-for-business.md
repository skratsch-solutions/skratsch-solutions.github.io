Hey there! Are you trying to wrap your head around SharePoint and OneDrive for Business? Don’t worry, you’re not the only one scratching their head. Let’s clear things up a bit.

## OneDrive and OneDrive For Business are Not The Same

First off, OneDrive is different from OneDrive for Business. The personal version of OneDrive is free for anyone with a Microsoft account. On the flip side, OneDrive for Business is part of your Microsoft 365 Business license.

## SharePoint Online and SharePoint are Not The Same

Now, SharePoint Online, which is part of Microsoft 365, is not the same as the on-premise version. In this post, when I say SharePoint, I’m talking about SharePoint Online.

## Storing and Sharing Files

Both SharePoint and OneDrive are great for storing and sharing files. When you hit ‘save’ on a Word or Excel doc, you’ll see options for both. But how much can you store? SharePoint Online offers 1 TB for your organization plus an extra 10 GB for each license you buy. OneDrive for Business starts you off with a generous 5 TB per user, and that can even be bumped up to 25 TB.

Thinking about where to save your files? SharePoint Online is all about teamwork. It’s perfect for creating team sites, intranets, and even mobile apps. It’s big on data security, automating work, and managing data governance policies.

OneDrive for Business, on the other hand, is about straightforward file sharing. It’s a central spot for all your files, accessible from any device, and you can share files securely with others, both inside and outside your company.

### Setting up a SharePoint Site

When it comes to setting up a SharePoint site, think of it as designing a website tailored to your team's needs. Beyond just sharing files, you can:

- **Embed Calendars**: Keep everyone on track by integrating calendars directly into your SharePoint site.
- **Create a Site Newsfeed**: Share updates, announcements, and important information with your team.
- **Sync Project Plans (using Planner)**: Collaborate seamlessly on project management tasks.
- **Share a Synchronized OneDrive Notebook**: Centralize your notes and ideas for easy access.
- **Customize Branding**: Match the site's look and feel to your project or organization.

Remember, SharePoint is more than just a file repository—it's a dynamic collaboration hub!

### File Syncing Between OneDrive and SharePoint**

It's common to feel a bit puzzled about how files interact between OneDrive, SharePoint, and even Microsoft Teams (which we'll explore in a future post). Here's the scoop:

1. **OneDrive**: When you save a file to OneDrive, it might appear to have a SharePoint location. Why? Because it's tucked away in your company's directory under a "PERSONAL" folder.

2. **Sync Settings**: Who controls the sync settings? Well, that's either your Microsoft 365 Administrator or your trusty [Microsoft Office 365 Partner](/it-services/microsoft-365).

> - **SharePoint**: The admin sets up sites and folders with sharing permissions.
> - **OneDrive**: You, the user, decide which folders/files are shared (within the security limits set by the admin).

### Sharing Files Without Attachments

Tired of bulky email attachments? Good news! Instead of attaching files directly to emails, you can now send a link. Here's why it's awesome:

1. **Space Saver**: Reduce your mailbox size by avoiding attachments.
2. **Collaboration Boost**: Multiple people can edit the same file simultaneously.
3. **Flexible Sharing**: Send links to specific email addresses, anyone with the link, or even SharePoint team sites and OneDrive shared directories.

Give it a try - it's a game-changer!

### Data Retention Made Easy

Both OneDrive for Business and SharePoint come with powerful compliance features to keep your data secure and organized:

1. **Activity Auditing**: Keep track of who accessed, deleted, or shared files.
2. **Data Loss Prevention**: Safeguard sensitive information from accidental leaks.
3. **Retention Policies**: Automate content retention or deletion based on predefined timeframes.
4. **eDiscovery Case Management**: Identify and preserve content for legal purposes.
5. **Alerts**: Admins and managers receive notifications for specific user activities.

Stay in control and protect your data effortlessly!
