This is the time of year where businesses are looking over their IT
budgets and deciding on whether to buy new computers this year or next.
Buying new computers for a business is always challenging -- but
especially right now.

Beyond the widely reported computer chip shortage, global supply chain
issues are creating delays for video cards, computer monitors, and other
hardware components. When you add the launch of Windows 11 to the mix,
you have a perfect supply chain storm. Computer buyers can expect to see
both higher prices and longer lead times.

## If you are considering buying new computers right now, we have a few words of advice:

### 1. Always consult your IT team first.

The IT professionals who are expected to maintain and support your IT
infrastructure should be included in any buying decisions. Having an IT
purchasing team can help you meet employee needs and stay within the IT
budget, making dozens of decisions, like: 

> *Laptop computers or desktops? What screen size? Do we need new
> monitors too? How much processing speed? Intel Core? Which one? How
> many USB ports? Which graphics card? Solid-state drive? How much
> storage space? How much RAM? Which brand? Which operating system? Do
> any employees need a DVD drive? *

The list goes on and on, which is why we always encourage our clients to
[call us](/contact)
before making any major technology purchase. (Seriously, one 15-minute
phone call can save a lot of time, money, and frustration!)

### 2. Buy for Windows 11 readiness

Any computer you buy new today should meet the technical specifications
required to run Windows 11. Many models are shipping with Windows 10
installed, but promising compatibility with Windows 11 when you're ready
to upgrade.

While you want to ensure you can [upgrade to Windows 11](/business/upgrading-to-windows-11) -- you may not want to do so just yet.

1.  Having employees on different operating systems makes technical
    troubleshooting and IT support more difficult.
2.  Existing [software     applications](/software/selecting-small-business-software) may not be compatible with Windows 11 yet.
3.  You can let the early adopters find the bugs and figure out the
    shortcuts, so you get faster time-to-value when you decide to
    upgrade.

### 3. Stick to your computer specs.

Business computers should last about 5 years. By the end of that
timespan, the [computer is usually out of warranty](/business/computer-warranties) and technology has advanced enough to warrant a
replacement.

With computer supply chain shortages, you may be tempted to buy
something "just for now" only to find out that the computer doesn't
really meet your needs. For that reason, we typically try to steer
clients away from all-in-one computers and instead have a more modular
"built" computer that allows you to swap out peripherals and add more
memory when part(s) are back in stock.

Don't start shopping for new computers until you've clearly defined your
list of must-have and nice-to-have features. There's nothing worse than
having a brand new computer -- only to realize you don't have a wireless
card or there's no way to connect to an older monitor. You'll save
yourself a lot of time and trouble if you buy all your computer hardware
from a single manufacturer (like Dell). However, you will probably want
to create different computer specs for different job functions. Some
employees only need a bare-bones computer for document processing or to
connect to a virtual desktop. Other employees will likely need
high-performance machines for data-crunching and memory-intensive
processes.

### 4. Plan ahead.

Right now we're seeing lead times for delivery about 60 days out. If you
want to pay for new computer equipment out of this year's budget, we
recommend ordering your computers now, but recognize you may not take
delivery until the new year. You can use this lead time to plan a smooth
rollout.

We're here to help you select the right computer hardware and transfer
your data so employees can hit the ground running, working productively
from home or in the office.
