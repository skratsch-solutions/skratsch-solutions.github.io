### Choosing the right programming language, web framework, and database for custom software matters based on project specifics. While Django and Python offer rapid development and scalability, other tools may suit unique needs.

Does it matter what programming language, web framework, or database is
used to build a custom software application?

Mostly no, but sometimes yes.

When prospective clients ask about our expertise in specific programming
languages (Django, C#, .NET, JavaScript, Rails, etc.), it's usually
because they want us to take over the management of an existing custom
software project. That makes sense when the project is relatively
recent. However, sometimes being too specific in your requirements can
backfire.

For example, we've had numerous calls for [Access database](/software/ms-access-databases-make-the-move) development work. We are pros at Microsoft Access. But
also... when you already have to upgrade a 10-year-old Access database,
we may propose an alternative solution that's a better fit for your
needs. More modern. More secure. Less expensive. And developed faster.

For the most part, we're "vendor agnostic." We care about finding the
right solution for YOU. And in most cases, people don't care which
toolsets we use for a software development project. We're committed to
delivering an outcome.

We use the tools that make sense for the project. When unspecified, our
go-to software stack is Django and Python. Django is a web framework
that supports rapid application development (RAD), and Python is the
underlying programming language.

Django calls itself "the web framework for perfectionists with
deadlines," which describes us pretty well. These solutions are not the
only tools in our toolbelt, but they're easy, familiar, and open source,
which makes them a great fit for many reasons.

## 5 reasons to use Django and Python

**1. You need a solution built quickly.** Django is a "batteries
included framework." Using a rapid application development (RAD) tool
like Django cuts cost and time because we don't have to reinvent the
wheel. Instead, we can use both built-in components and 3rd party
modules.

**2. You want a cross platform framework.** When we know an application
needs to be compatible with a Windows only library, we'll use .NET and
C# because those are the best tools for the job. However, often clients
want the flexibility of hosting the application on any operating system
-- Linux, Mac, or Windows. With Django and Python, you can move the
application to another operating system anytime.

**3. You want to leverage built-in security features.** Please note that
no matter how you approach your software development project, you do NOT
want your developers building their own security framework. It is WAY
too risky, especially when there are plenty of solid pre-built modules
available.

**4. You want assurance that you can find other support if needed.**
Django and Python are popular, with a large community of resources to
lean on for dev-to-dev support. Tons of third-party libraries are widely
available. Plus, they have EXCELLENT documentation. By using the most
popular web framework, you give yourself plenty of options to transition
later to another developer or bring the project in house.

**5. You want a solution that will scale.** Instagram is built using
Django, so you can be assured Django will scale as large as you need it
to. Its built-in caching system is robust enough to create a smooth user
experience.

Most of the apps and interfaces we build are either automating internal
processes or start with an externally facing form, which then kicks off
an internal process. We wouldn't use Django to build stock trading
software or a role-playing video game, but for most business
applications, Django is an excellent choice.

Programmers often say "Python is the second-best language for
everything" -- but the beauty is that you can do everything in one
language. When it comes to web applications, the speed of development is
often more important than computational power.

If you don't know what you need, that's the perfect place to start. Our
team has been [building custom software](/software-developmen/development) for over 20 years. While our default tools are Django
and Python, we still actively maintain our skills and support
applications that use other programming languages and databases. Please
reach out for help exploring the possibilities.
