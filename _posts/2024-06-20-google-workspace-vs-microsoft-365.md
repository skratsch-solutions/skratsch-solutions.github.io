In 2020, G suite became Google Workspace and Office 365 became Microsoft 365. The names have changed but they're still great tools with even more features now.

## Google Workspace vs Microsoft 365: Both offer business email plus productivity apps

For most businesses, email is the #1 tool for business communication.

Your employees' email inboxes contain valuable messages from customers, vendors, partners, and employees. Email makes it easy to collaborate. Plus, email is the foundational tool for signing into both local and online software programs.

For those reasons – and many more highlighted in detail below – you need a professional email system, like those included with Microsoft 365 or Google Workplace.

## Why personal email systems are bad for business

Before we jump into the difference of which business email platform to pick (Google Workspace or Microsoft 365) let's talk about some of the main reasons you need to move away from using Yahoo, Gmail, and Comcast for business emails. Here are 5 reasons why we strongly recommend switching to either Google Workspace or [Microsoft 365.](/it-services/microsoft-365).

### Personal email accounts don't promote your brand

We're an [IT Services firm](/it-services), not a marketing company, but we try to look at all the business benefits of your technology decisions. When you hand someone a business card that has @aol, @yahoo or @hotmail on it, the recipient may assume that either you're not a very modern company or that you're not serious about your business. Branding your email with your domain is easy and it gives you an opportunity to present a polished image to the world.

### Personal email accounts have a higher risk of being spoofed

Anyone can setup a gmail email address. It's free. That means it's easy to spoof an email. So let's say all your employees have their own personal gmail account. A malicious individual can create a very similar gmail address to impersonate an employee, then ask for credentials to get into other systems. We've seen this happen more than once! Unless you have eagle eyes, it's easy to miss.

A benefit of using Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 is that you're more likely to see that the sender is coming from an outside domain. Both systems have authentication procedures and built-in data security tools to ensure your data stays protected.

## Benefits of Google Workspace and Microsoft 365

### Collaboration tools

Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 are the ultimate collaboration tools, making it easier to:

- Share files and calendars
- Simultaneously edit documents
- Connect via chat or video conference
- Book shared resources like conference rooms or phone lines

These business platforms make running a business so much easier, especially when employees are working from different locations.

### Better technical support

If something happens to your personal email account, there's no one available to help. By contrast, Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 have thousands of support articles online, live chat, telephone support, plus an army of technology partners (like us!) who can diagnose and repair your business systems when you encounter issues.

### Manage employee's credentials

What happens if an employee leaves? If employees are using a personal email account, their account walks out the door with them. Even if you have their password, they can change it. Why would you risk losing those valuable business contacts and business data? You shouldn't.

## Moving to a business platform: Google Workspace vs Microsoft 365

The irony of persuading clients to move to Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 for email is that most businesses are already using Google, Microsoft (or Apple) business productivity apps. If you already have a favorite standard solution for your word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations, your choice of business email systems should be easier.

- If you're already a fan of Google Sheets, Docs and Drive, go with [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)
- If you prefer Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365) is the natural fit
- If you use a mix of both, realize that standardizing on one platform is going to be much easier to manage in the long run.

## Migrating existing emails

When you switch to a new email platform, we can either bring in all the existing emails and contacts, or you can choose to start fresh, running both email accounts until you are fully transitioned. The switch is much simpler than you might think.
