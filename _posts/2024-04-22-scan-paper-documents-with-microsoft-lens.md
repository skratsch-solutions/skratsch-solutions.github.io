Office Lens is like having a pocket-sized scanner in your phone. It lets you capture photos of whiteboards, documents, or business cards, and then magically turns them into digital files. You can save these scans to OneDrive, OneNote, or even export them as Word or PDF documents. Whether you’re organizing receipts, digitizing handwritten notes, or managing business cards, Office Lens simplifies the process and keeps everything neat and tidy. Plus, it’s free!

## Versatile Document Scanning with Office Lens

- **Contract Management**: Effortlessly scan signed contracts and archive them in your client’s OneDrive.
- **Networking Simplified**: Digitize business cards directly into your Outlook or CRM system.
- **Creative Collaboration**: Capture whiteboard sessions to preserve and share your team’s ideas.
- **Photo Preservation**: Save old photographs in digital form for posterity.
- **Digitizing Paper**: Scan paper documents to turn them into editable Word documents

## 12 Steps to Getting Started with Office Lens

## Office Lens Best Practices

Once you start using it, you’ll wonder how you managed without it. Our entire team relies on it both in and out of the office. If you’re using Office Lens in a business environment, consider implementing some IT policies and procedures related to document retention:

- **Document Naming**: Establish guidelines for naming documents consistently. Clear, descriptive names make organization and retrieval easier.
- **Storage Locations**: Decide where documents should be stored. Whether it’s OneDrive, SharePoint, or another location, consistency matters.
- **Contact Management**: Determine which contacts should be added to your company database. Keep it up-to-date for efficient collaboration.
