Just like the dashboard of your car helps you navigate safely to your
destination, your business dashboard puts your most valuable information
at your fingertips.

[Data-driven businesses use dashboards](/data-services/business-reports-dashboards) to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics,
and other key data points related to a business, department, or specific
process. The idea is to give users a simple way to help your
organization improve performance and streamline processes.

## How can companies use business dashboards?

A well-designed dashboard can help to align organizational efforts, make
fast, informed decisions, and improve business performance. Common
objectives are to:

**Align departments.** For example, you may want to give the
manufacturing department better visibility into the sales forecast for
better demand planning.

**Consolidate information from multiple software
applications.** Combining information from an accounting system
like [QuickBooks](/software/quickbooks-and-customer-management) with a customer relationship management (CRM) system
used by your sales teams can help you use your data to make better
business decisions.

**Track performance and spot trends over time.** By comparing current
data with historical data, like month over month or year over year, you
can discover patterns, track KPIs, and drill down to find the root cause
of any changes.

**Detect anomalies.** Companies can add automation that get triggered
when various thresholds are reached or anomalies are detected.

**Monitor business health.** Key metrics can be used to measure
performance.

## Reporting vs. dashboards: Understanding the difference

Many companies still run using month-end and year-end reports. Someone
usually has to spend hours manipulating Excel spreadsheets and mastering
the art of the pivot table and PowerPoint to turn raw data into usable
information. But even then, most reports only show what's already
happened.

By contrast, business dashboards provide near real-time data, and often
allow the user to drill down to see the detail. Operational dashboards
can be built for any set of users. They give organizations agility by
providing users with the information they need to make informed
decisions in the moment, like:

-   Adjusting the marketing budget based on campaign effectiveness or
    current lead flow
-   Re-routing service personnel based on weather or traffic
-   Shifting the production schedule based on inventory availability

While executive dashboards will provide the big picture with charts and
metrics providing insight into the overall health of the company,
comparing actuals to goals, most users will primarily use a departmental
dashboard for their business area.

A financial dashboard might show:

-   Current bank account balances
-   Outstanding receivables and payables
-   Sales forecast for the next 30-60-90 days
-   Departmental budgets
-   Profit margins by category

Sales dashboards would contain completely different information, and
might include:

-   Number of new sales inquiries
-   Customer acquisition charts
-   Rolodex of customer contact information
-   Sales pipeline broken down by rep, team, line, or sales stage
-   List of current discounts, promotions and marketing campaigns
