Hurricanes. Floods. Fires. Tornados. Natural disasters remind us that we
can't control everything. What we can control is how we prepare in
advance and how we respond afterward.

## Disaster recovery planning is critical!

Imagine that a fire burnt your business to the ground overnight. How
quickly could you get back up and running?

I worry about all the small businesses in Houston and Florida.

-   Will their employees and vendors get paid?
-   How quickly will they be able to re-open their doors?
-   Will they be able to restore from back up? Have they ever tested the
    process?
-   Do they have all the vital information about their technology
    environment?
-   Have they relied on vendors or consultants who may have lost all
    their data in the disaster?

## Remember those fire drills from grade school.

While as kids, this exercise was a fun break from the school day,
schools were taking responsibility for the fact that in a disaster, they
are responsible for their students' well-being. They wanted every
teacher and every student to know exactly what to do -- without
question. Each drill helped them refine the process and reinforce the
learning.  Guess what?

As the business owner, you are 100% responsible for your business.

Not your employees.

Not your vendors or consultants.

**YOU!**

And if disaster strikes, it pays to be prepared.  Most businesses need
two plans -- a business continuity plan and a disaster recovery plan.

## Creating a Business Continuity Plan

Some businesses must find a way to continue, even in a disaster.
Most businesses would prefer to minimize business disruption. A business
continuity plan helps you figure out what you need to keep operations up
and running.

-   Can you keep your business going by switching operations to a remote
    location?
-   Are there areas of the business that you should shut down so you can
    focus on more vital business functions?
-   What is the minimum skeleton infrastructure you need to keep going?

We can help you think through every step of the process. During
Hurricane Sandy, [backup generators failed](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493223/data-center/hurricane-sandy--backup-generators-fail-at-major-new-york-hospitals.html) at major New York hospitals. Hospital
employees had to carry fuel up multiple flights of stairs to feed the
generators. Patients' lives were at risk. The hospitals had business
continuity plans, but they didn't do enough testing.

Like a fire drill, it's important to physically walk through the steps
to see how much time it takes, and where there are inefficiencies or
missing steps. We frequently see companies make backup after backup, but
when they finally try to recover the data -- something goes wrong. Don't
skip this step! This step can help you avoid areas where a "single point
of failure" could sabotage the rest of the plan.

## Creating a Disaster Recovery Plan

The other vital plan is a disaster recovery plan. You may not be in an
area that has frequent natural disasters, but you are still vulnerable
to hardware failures, employee mistakes,
[malware](/security/data-breach-prevention-essentials), theft, fire, and other data loss vulnerabilities.

If in some unforeseen disaster, you lose your data -- or access to your
data -- you'll want to think about:

-   How quickly you need to be back up and running?
-   How much data can you afford to lose?

Read the rest of our [backup and recovery best practice](/it-services/backup-and-recovery-services)
recommendations.

## Building your Emergency Binder

Whether you have a disaster or not, you need what we refer to as "a red
binder." This binder is not always red, and it's not always a physical
binder. But it is essential to data security. In this binder, you need
to have up-to-date information about:

-   All software programs and passwords
-   File names
-   Configuration settings
-   Support phone numbers

Your emergency may be that the IT guy quits. Then what? How do you get
someone to fill his or her shoes? The red binder ensures that you, as
the business owner, can access your computer systems, even if you never
want to or need to.

## Don't forget about the Disaster Recovery Plans of Your Vendors

It doesn't have to be your disaster to need a disaster recovery plan. Do
you know how much backup infrastructure your cloud-based software
programs have? A smaller cloud-based CRM company went out of business as
the result of Katrina. Everyone on that system lost their customer data.
Horror stories abound about programmers losing custom source code.
Fortunately, thanks to inexpensive online data storage, this happens
less frequently.

## Data Recovery Is About Reducing Risk

Yes, there is a real cost to having [data recovery plans](/it-services/backup-and-recovery-services) and
business continuity plans. Just like there is a real cost to insurance. 
What could be more important than keeping your business up and running?
If your business can continue to thrive, you can continue earning money
to re-purchase any material positions. If your business fails (as 66% do
after a major data loss), you start over, perhaps with debt. It's not
fun.

We are very mindful of that as a small business, you may have very real
budgetary limits. We work hard to help you understand your risks and
your options and make the decision that's right for your business.
