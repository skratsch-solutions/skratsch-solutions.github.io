## Software rollout best practices

There are a few best practices to follow to ensure that your custom code
won't break when you move it into production.Â Here at Skratsch Solutions, these are the steps we take with our custom software
rollouts:

1.  **Test code in staging.** First, we ask for all parties (your end
    users as well as the project team members) to [test the     application](/software/why-is-pre-rollout-software-testing-important) in a staging environment that closely mirrors your
    production environment. This helps identify any issues that might
    arise when the project is deployed in a live environment. This
    process is also part of acceptance testing, making sure the program
    is working as all stakeholders expect it to work.
2.  **Maintain version control.** We maintain a version control system
    to manage and track changes to your code. We can create a separate
    branch for each update or feature, and then merge those changes into
    the main codebase when they are ready. This way we can easily see
    what changes were made and by whom, and makes it easier to roll back
    to a previous version if necessary.
3.  **Create release notes with each software update.** We take note of
    the changes that were made, any known issues or bugs, and any other
    relevant information. This can help users and other stakeholders
    understand what has changed and can also serve as a reference for
    future updates.
4.  **Monitor for errors** Finally, we'll often implement alerting
    tools to help us quickly identify and fix any issues that arise in
    your production environment. We also make any necessary adjustments
    to ensure that the software will continue to operate efficiently and
    effectively over time.
5.  **Keeping project up to date.** If you have a maintenance agreement
    in place, we can also monitor the frameworks and third-party
    libraries to address changes. Non-urgent updates are addressed on a
    regular schedule. But changes that address security concerns are
    prioritized and addressed "out of band" as needed.
