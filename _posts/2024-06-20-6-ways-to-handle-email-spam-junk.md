Managing spam and junk emails in Outlook can be tedious and pose security risks. To maintain a clean inbox, consider these strategies:

- **Selective Email Sharing**: Use a client-exclusive email or alias to prevent your primary address from being compromised. Implement filters to separate these from general inquiries.
- **Inbox Organization**: Utilize Outlook's Focused Inbox and filtering options to prioritize important messages.
- **Spam Reporting**: Aid Outlook's learning by reporting junk emails, adjusting the junk filter sensitivity to suit your needs.
- **Sender Blocking**: Block persistent spammers to direct their messages straight to the junk folder.
- **Safe Senders List**: Ensure trusted contacts' emails bypass the junk folder by adding them to your Safe Senders list.
- **Unsubscribe from Newsletters**: Reduce clutter by unsubscribing from unread newsletters or using services like Unroll.me for consolidation.

Remember, while it's impossible to eliminate spam entirely, these practices will significantly reduce your workload. For further assistance, reach out to our team.
