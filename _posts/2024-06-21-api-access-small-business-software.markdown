When companies buy [small business software](/business/small-business-software-work-efficiently/index.html), they usually think about the features and functions
they need, but quite often forget how to ask:

-   Will this software easily fit into my IT environment?
-   Does the software offer API access so I can create streamlined
    workflows for my employees?
-   Does the software include an SDK (software development kit) in case
    I want to [customize the     software](/software-development/customization)
    later?

Let's talk specifically about API access and why it's so important.

## What's an API?

API stands for application programming interface. An API acts almost
like an extension cord you would use in your house. It can be used to
connect two different programs together -- or even build a customized
extension to the application.

The API provides standard building blocks that other software developers
can use to connect to customizable components of a program, ensuring
that calls securely access the right bundle of resources.

## How might API access be used?

An API is often used to send information from one program into another.
For example, you might take an eCommerce order from your website. The
API call would then automatically send that contact and order data into
your customer relationship management system to fulfill the order. The
benefit of having an API is that the programmers who developed the
software don't have to understand the structure of any other software,
and they don't risk accidentally compromising the code of the other
product.

## Using integration tools

Software programs with API can sometimes allow you to use [low-code integration tools like Zapier](/software/low-code-apps-vs-custom-software) to connect
different applications and automate standard workflows without having to
create custom code. Of course, if you need specialized automation and
help with [software integration](/software-development/integration),
that's something that our [software development team](/software-development) can help with.

## What if my software doesn't have an API?

If you buy software that doesn't provide API access, customizing it to
meet your needs is going to be more difficult, more expensive, and maybe
even impossible. Programmers don't want other programmers touching their
source code because it threatens the stability of the system.

Most [modern small business software](/software/selecting-small-business-software/index.html) will come
with API access. The fact that a software program today does not allow
API access should be a red flag. If you are evaluating different small
business software packages, and would like our professional IT opinion
