title: "Securing Your Digital Realm: Effective IT Policies and Procedures for Safeguarding Data"
excerpt: "Do you have a tight onboarding / offboarding checklist you use when hiring a new employee or consultant? If not, it's likely you have 'ghosts in the machine', that is,  people who can still access your data, even though they no longer have an affiliation with your company."

## Banish the Ghosts in Your IT Systems

At Skratsch Solutions, we understand the importance of airtight IT policies and procedures. Without them, you risk having "ghosts" in your system - former employees or consultants who retain access to your data. These "friendly ghosts" might not intend harm, but their lingering presence can lead to security breaches, unauthorized data sharing, and unattended customer inquiries.

## Proactive IT Security Measures

To exorcise these ghosts, we recommend:

- **Quarterly Authorization Audits**: Regularly review all software profiles to identify and remove outdated user access, especially in high-turnover environments.
- **Document Access Points**: Keep a record of program access granted to employees or consultants, ensuring you can easily revoke it when necessary.
- **Robust Onboarding/Offboarding**: Impress new hires with ready-to-go workstations and access, and ensure a smooth transition when they depart. Include security measures like keys, codes, passwords, and access to shared files in your checklist.

## Legal Protection and Support

If you suspect misuse of your data, legal actions are available. Lack of access revocation doesn't grant former affiliates the right to your private information.
