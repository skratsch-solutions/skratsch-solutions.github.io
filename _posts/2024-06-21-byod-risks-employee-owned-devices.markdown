Are you concerned about BYOD risks? Bring your own device (BYOD) is the
practice of allowing employees to use their own technology for
company-sanctioned work. BYOD seeped into office culture as mobile
phones became more common. Over time, employees started connecting their
work email and taking work calls on their mobile devices. Companies
struggled to figure out who needed company-issued devices and how to
regulate personal devices.  

On the surface, BYOD seems like a win-win situation. Numerous studies
have shown that allowing employees to use their own devices at work
improves worker morale and productivity. Companies like the perceived
cost savings. They don't have to buy, maintain, and manage
employee-owned devices. Employees like the freedom of choosing their own
technology and the convenience of only having one device to manage.  

There's no doubt that BYOD is here to stay. In fact, in our new hybrid /
work-at-home era, the use of employee-owned computers, printers, and
smartphones has dramatically expanded. And while this arrangement makes
sense in many ways, businesses need to be aware of the risks.  

## Company vs. employee-owned devices

The risks that come from company-owned devices are also risks
for employee-owned devices. The difference is that when you own the
equipment, you have more control. Many companies prefer to issue
equipment to employees because then the company has more administrative
power to enforce compliance with company policy.   

##  What are the top BYOD security risks?

### 1. Malware and malicious apps

Working on their own devices, employees may visit insecure sites and
download all sorts of information. Unfortunately, some of these
downloads may include malware, including computer viruses, spyware,
adware, trojans, worms, rootkits, and keyloggers. Malware attacks, and
especially [ransomware attacks](/security/how-to-identify-malicious-email), are on the rise. If these threats get onto [employee devices](/security/importance-of-endpoint-management-malware-prevention), they may go undetected for quite some time and
ultimately infect your company files.  

### 2. Data security breaches

A [security breach](/security/prevent-data-security-breaches) can happen anywhere---from a home network to public
Wi-Fi hotspots. Employees may not think about the ramifications of
sharing a sensitive file over an insecure network. If you're not careful
about securing sensitive content, hackers could easily get into those
files. This puts all of your organization's confidential information at
risk. If the device is lost or stolen, malicious individuals may have
easy access into your entire company network.  

### 3. Sensitive data leaks

One of the biggest concerns when it comes to BYOD programs is potential
data leakage. When employees are using their own devices to access
sensitive business information such as financial records, customer
lists, intellectual property, etc., you're vulnerable to having this
information exposed.  

If your company has to comply with regulatory requirements like HIPAA,
or handles sensitive information like social security numbers, you need
to be extra cautious to make sure that any personally identifiable
information isn't accessible by anyone other than authorized
personnel.  

### 4. Data loss

Whether it's a lost device, a hardware failure, or a file that wasn't
backed up because it was stored outside of the company network, data
loss is a common risk and valid concern.  

## How to mitigate BYOD risks

### 1. Strong BYOD policies with good ongoing communication

When it's the employee's device, you must find ways to safeguard your
organization. At the very least, you need to be clear about your
expectations, rights, and responsibilities, preferably in a written BYOD
security policy. Clarify who is responsible for maintaining [anti-virus software](/security/how-to-identify-malicious-email) and what happens if the device is lost or stolen. Let
them know your expectations for company information being backed up and
where it can and cannot be stored.  

And don't just put this information in a company policy that gets stuck
at the bottom of a file drawer. Reinforce the importance of your data
security measures on a regular basis.  

### 2. BYOD security practices and tools

You know that no matter how solid of a BYOD policy you create or how
many times you tell employees they need [strong passwords](/security/password-security-best-practices), they may not always follow [data security best practices](/security/data-breach-prevention-essentials). You can mitigate BYOD risks with security tools that
keep work and personal life separate and protect company data.   

**Virtualization** Some companies set up virtualized desktops to help
employees create a dedicated, secure workspace. The virtual desktop
automatically stores all applications and files on shared drives and
allows for centralized IT administration, monitoring, and backups.  

**VPN** A VPN can protect communications from being intercepted. 

**App segregation** Some devices allow you to have one workspace for
work and one for personal tasks, which helps to decrease accidental
sharing of the wrong information.

**Content-level security** Some apps provide content-level security,
meaning that even if an unauthorized individual can find a file, they
may not be able to open it or read it unless they know the password or
have the credentials to decrypt the file.  

**Mobile device management (MDM) and endpoint security** If a device
is lost or stolen, if you have device-management capabilities, you may
be able to remotely wipe the device the next time it connects to the
Internet.  

**Anti-virus software and [firewall protection](/security/business-firewalls-computer-network)** Some employers pay for enterprise-grade security
tools to manage employee-owned devices.  

### 3. Monitoring and maintenance procedures

The challenge with BYOD is that there's a wide range of devices and use
scenarios -- between the employee who occasionally checks work email on
a personal phone and an employee who is using their laptop every day for
company business. How much monitoring you do, and who's responsible for
device maintenance is up to you.  

To start, you'll want to think through how to handle:

-   Routine backups  
-   Applying security patches  
-   File sharing
-   Email and content monitoring
-   Malware detection and removal

## Embracing employee-owned devices

While we've focused entirely on the risks for employee-owned devices,
BYOD also has many advantages. You have less hardware to buy. Employees
are happier. Teammates can stay connected as they work from anywhere.

employee-owned devices? Have you found BYOD solutions that work great
for you?
