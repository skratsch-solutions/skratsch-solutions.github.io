- Add comments or suggestions to specific lines of code or files
- Vote on the pull request by choosing one of the options: approve, approve with suggestions, wait for author, reject, or no vote
- Optionally, complete or abandon the pull request if you have permission

### Integrating Azure Repos with Other Azure DevOps Services

#### Linking Commits to Work Items in Azure Boards

One of the benefits of using Azure Repos is its integration with Azure Boards, a service that helps teams plan and track work. You can link your commits to work items in Azure Boards, such as user stories, tasks, or bugs. This way, you can easily see the progress and status of your work items and the code changes associated with them.

To link a commit to a work item, you need to use a special syntax in your commit message. The syntax is `#<work item ID>`, where `<work item ID>` is the ID number of the work item you want to link. For example, if you want to link your commit to a work item with ID 123, you can write something like this:

`Fixed a typo in the readme file #123`

You can also link multiple work items in the same commit message by using commas or spaces between them. For example:

`Added new features and fixed some bugs #456, #789`

#### Triggering Builds in Azure Pipelines with Commits

Another benefit of using Azure Repos is its integration with Azure Pipelines, a service that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your projects. You can trigger builds in Azure Pipelines with your commits, which means that every time you push your code changes to Azure Repos, a build process will run automatically. This process will compile your code, run tests, and deploy your application.

To trigger builds in Azure Pipelines with your commits, you need to create a pipeline for your project and configure it to use your repository as the source. You can also specify which branches or paths you want to trigger the build and what steps you want to perform in the build process. You can use YAML files or graphical editors to create and edit your pipeline.

You can view the status and results of your builds on the Azure DevOps dashboard or on the Azure Repos web interface. You can also see the details of each build, such as the duration, logs, artifacts, and test results.

### Best Practices for Using Azure Repos

#### Tips for Effective Use of Azure Repos

Azure Repos is a powerful and flexible service that can help you manage your code changes and collaborate with other developers. However, to get the most out of Azure Repos, you need to follow some best practices. Here are some tips to help you use Azure Repos effectively:

- Use descriptive and consistent names for your repositories, branches, and commits. This will make it easier to identify and track your code changes.
- Follow a branching strategy that suits your team's workflow and goals. For example, you can use a feature branch workflow, where each feature or bug fix is developed in a separate branch and merged into the main branch after review and testing.
- Use pull requests to review and approve code changes before merging them into the main branch. This will ensure code quality and prevent conflicts.
- Write clear and informative commit messages that explain what you did and why. This will help you and other developers understand the history and context of your code changes.
- Keep your commits small and focused on a single task or issue. This will make it easier to review, test, and revert your code changes if needed.

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

While Azure Repos is a user-friendly and reliable service, there are some common pitfalls that you should avoid when using it. Here are some of them:

- Don't commit sensitive or confidential information to your repositories, such as passwords, keys, or tokens. This can expose your data to unauthorized access or misuse. Instead, use environment variables or secrets management tools to store and access your sensitive data.
- Don't commit large or binary files to your repositories, such as images, videos, or libraries. This can make your repositories slow and bloated. Instead, use Azure Artifacts or other package management tools to store and share your large or binary files.
- Don't merge branches without testing or reviewing them first. This can introduce bugs or errors into your codebase. Instead, use Azure Pipelines or other testing tools to run automated tests on your branches before merging them.
- Don't ignore conflicts or errors when pushing or pulling changes from Azure Repos. This can cause inconsistencies or corruption in your codebase. Instead, resolve conflicts or errors as soon as possible using your Git client or the Azure Repos web interface.
