Meeting scheduling software programs are designed to cut down on
back-and-forth emails trying to find a time when everyone can meet.
Plus, these apps make it easy for clients to book their appointments.
The three best known meeting scheduling apps are:

-   [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)
-   [Acuity Scheduling](https://www.acuityscheduling.com/)
-   [Microsoft Bookings](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/scheduling-and-booking-app)

These calendar-based scheduling tools make it easy to set up your
availability, share your link, and start accepting meeting requests. All
of these apps include scheduling for any meeting type, including:

-   Online and in-person one-on-one meetings
-   Group classes
-   Round robin assignment of meeting requests

## Setting up meeting types

The first thing you need to do is determine your meeting types and
times. For example, let's say you're a tax preparer and you have three
meeting types:

-   Project Status Update Meeting -- 15 minutes
-   Initial Consultation -- 1 hour
-   Complete Technology Consultation -- 2 hours

You'd create each of these meetings in your scheduling app with
additional details like:

-   The employee(s) who can be scheduled for this meeting time
-   The buffer time needed before and after the meeting
-   Client contact info you want to collect -- like phone number, email,
    and meeting topic
-   Meeting location with the Zoom / Teams link or the office address
-   Cost and payment method

The apps can pull for availability on your work calendars [(Google or Microsoft 365)](/business/google-workspace-vs-microsoft-365/index.html) or you can create a custom schedule. For example, you
may only want to do Complex Tax Consultations in the afternoons or only
meet with potential new clients on Mondays and Wednesdays.

You can also add automated email and SMS meeting reminders to increase
the likelihood that the meeting recipient will show up.

Once you have your meetings set up, you can easily put the link(s) on
your website or in emails.

## Requesting meetings

Visitors clicking your scheduling link will see all open appointment
dates and times for the meeting type they requested. They'll simply
click the date and time to book and continue. Calendly and Microsoft
Bookings examples are shown below.

Based on your settings, you will each receive an email with the meeting
details and the time will be blocked off in your calendar.

## Booking etiquette

Is it rude to send someone your link? Some people think so. But the
context is important. If they have a work-stopping issue and need your
help ASAP, asking them to schedule a meeting out in the future is
frustrating.

If you're the one asking for the meeting, don't expect them to do the
booking. As this "[Is Calendly Rude?](https://calendly.com/blog/is-calendly-rude) blog post points out, the polite thing to do
is to first ask if they have a calendar link or a list of available
times and dates to share with you. Then you can follow up with an email
providing your availability, and a booking link they can use if they'd
like.

Give people the option to book with ease online, but realize that
adjusting to online scheduling might be new to some people. Be patient
while they learn the system and respect that some people will always
want to schedule a meeting in person or on the phone.
