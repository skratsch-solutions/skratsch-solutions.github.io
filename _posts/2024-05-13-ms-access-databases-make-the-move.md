_Once upon a time…_

## MS Access databases were everywhere

In fact, Microsoft Access databases are still used in lots of small-to-medium businesses because the applications developed years ago still work.

The obvious question then is…

**If your MS Access application still works, why would you change anything?**

Because old technology, even if it's technically _FREE_, isn't really free. The costs are just hidden. We covered this topic in our article about the [Care and Feeding of Custom Software](/software/custom-software-development-care-feeding).

In a nutshell:

- You're missing out on modern efficiency gains
- You may be creating risks, especially in the areas of security, upgradability, and supportability

## MS Access has many great features

We've built many applications in Microsoft Access over the years. We liked MS Access because:

- It's inexpensive (the license is FREE) and requires no special hardware to run
- It has a graphical interface, which makes it easy to use
- It's an easy all-in-one simple solution, including extra features like a built-in form creator and report writer

On the downside… despite Microsoft's upgrades to the product, MS Access is unsophisticated and unwieldy compared to other options available today

- It's not very scalable. It's doesn't work well with more than about 10 concurrent users and can't handle high-volumes of data or complex algorithms
- Data security can be problematic. Role-based security features have been removed from the application
- It's not web-friendly
- Most software developers don't want to work with MS Access databases
- It's difficult to connect to other [small business software solutions](./software/evaluating-saas-solutions-small-biz) and SaaS offerings. There's no API connectivity

Microsoft Access has been around for more than 25 years now. It's had a great run. But in our opinion, it just can't compete with newly developed web-centric solutions.

Before switching to another [custom software application,](/software-services/development) the first step is to see whether a [small business software application](/software/small-business-software-work-efficiently) already exists that would meet your needs. When one doesn't exist, we've had several clients move off of MS Access to Django.

Their typical reaction is **_"Why didn't we switch sooner?!"_**

Other clients have moved off of Microsoft Access because they have too much data or too many users. One of the best reasons for working with Skratsch Solutions is that we don't prescribe THE answer. We ask the right questions to help you get the best answer for YOUR business.
