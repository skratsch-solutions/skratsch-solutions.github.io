## Small Business IT Strategy

Sometimes it's not what we DO that hurts our business growth, but rather
what we fail to do... like planning out our [small business IT strategy.](/consulting/it-strategy) Data silos
pop up because we don't have an IT technology plan. We don't always ask
the right questions to help us decide between [cloud and desktop software](/software/cloud-vs-desktop-software) or know how to
[evaluate SaaS solutions](/software/evaluating-saas-solutions-small-biz).

Let me ask you 3 questions:

### 1. How many small business software programs do you own?

**Think about the different areas of your business you manage with
software, including:**

-   Email Marketing Software to nurture prospective customers as well as
    existing customers
-   Customer Relationship Management Software to track sales and
    projects
-   Accounting Software to manage invoices and payables
-   Order Processing and Shipping Software to accept the order, process
    it, and ship it out
-   Website eCommerce Software to enable online orders
-   Support Software to handle case management and problem resolution
-   ...plus, all that day-to-day information that lives in your
    [**company's email system**](/it-services/email-management) and in
    **Excel spreadsheets**.

### 2. How well are your systems connected?

**Do you have [integrations built between the different software programs](/software-development-services/integration)?
Are you manually re-typing the information? Can you type information in
once and have it flow to the other systems? (For most small-to-medium
sized businesses, the answer is a resounding NO!)

### 3. What is it costing to have disconnected small business software?

There's a real cost to having your business information spread out
across multiple systems -- but it's a hidden cost. Because you're not
writing a check for it, you may not be thinking about the costs. If
you've never calculated the hidden costs, you may find the list below to
be eye-opening!

## 6 Ways Data Silos Kill Your Small Business

1.  **You can't see the big picture and therefore make informed
    decisions.** Without system integration, you'll never be able to get
    a 360 view of your customers -- or your business. Finding ways to
    integrate your data means you'll be able to view information from
    different angles to find root cause issues and identify
    opportunities for growth.
2.  **Your cost of overhead is too high.** Administrative re-typing of
    information is not a high-value task.  You may be "making due" with
    duplicate entry for a short time.... And yet, because you're so
    busy, you never make the time to actually find a solution to
    eliminate duplicate entry.
3.  **It's difficult to train new staff.** How can you delegate tasks
    effectively, when you have people jumping from software application
    to software application?
4.  **[Your data isn't reliable.](/data/bad-data-is-bad-for-business)** When you're running multiple software programs
    that overlap, it can become nearly impossible to keep the
    information in sync.
5.  **You can't grow your business effectively.** What if your business
    doubled overnight? Could you handle the additional workload? If
    you're spending lots of time on administrative work, adding
    customers will also mean adding more staff. Technology is an easy
    way to grow your bottom line, not just add customers and revenue.
6.  It's growing difficult to [manage network     security](/it-services/network-management). More
    systems and more passwords mean more [data security     risks](/security/prevent-data-security-breaches).

## Follow these Small Business System Integration Strategies

Have I convinced you? Maybe I have, but you're still wondering.... what
do I DO? I need these software programs to run my business.

1.  **Start by [developing an IT     Strategy](/consulting/it-strategy).**
    Companies acquire too many different software programs when they are
    working reactively, instead of sitting down and considering the best
    way to accomplish their objectives. Developing an IT Strategy
    ensures that your software programs can work together, either
    through API integration -- or because they're designed to work
    together.
2.  **Follow the KISS principle. Keep It Simple!** We've seen lots of
    clients over the years who have over engineered low-value processes.
    Keeping your processes and systems simple helps you create
    consistency in your business. [Document your business     processes](/consulting/it-policies-procedures).
    You want your flow to be as simple as possible -- but also to give
    you the information you need. Ask yourself if you have collected the
    data you need to make informed decisions. For example, you can't
    analyze clients by location if you've never collected their physical
    address.
3.  **[Integrate your     systems](/software-development-services/integration)
    and/or data.** If you're careful about always [buying software with     API integration](/software/api-access-small-business-software),
    sometimes your systems can be simply tied together with Zapier,
    Microsoft Flow or IFTTT (If this then that). When you need a more
    extensive integration than that, it pays to hire a software
    developer (like us) to build integration and workflow. If your
    systems need to be kept separate (like for HIPPA compliant
    software), you can use Business Analytics tools like Power BI to
    bring the key data points together for analysis.
