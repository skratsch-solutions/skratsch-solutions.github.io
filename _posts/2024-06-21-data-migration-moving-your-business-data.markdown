Whether buying a new server, new cloud storage, a new computer, or a new
software program, you'll want to think carefully about what information
will move over to the new system.

The default is to just "keep everything," but that's usually a mistake.
Just like when you move to a new office or house, moving systems creates
a natural opportunity to [purge items](/business/digital-spring-cleaning) that are no longer useful to your business. To avoid
cluttering up a new system with outdated information, we help clients
develop a data migration strategy.

## What is Data Migration?

Data migration is the process of moving data from one system to another.
That could mean a data storage location, a database or an application.
You will undergo a data migration anytime you:

-   Replace an existing application
-   Buy new computer hardware
-   Move to the cloud
-   Bring data into a new database or data warehouse
-   Build a new business process

## The ETL Process

Data migration is a one-time process that moves data from one system to
another. It doesn't matter where the data is housed -- on premises or in
the cloud. The transfer of data can be as simple as export-import -- or
[significantly more complex](/data/data-migration-dont-leave-to-last-minute. If the records in system A and system B have different
fields or a different schema, the data must be manipulated before it can
be brought into the new system.

ETL stands for extracting, transforming and loading. In the ETL process,
the data is first extracted from the old system, then it is transformed
(either manually or with a software program) so that it fits the format
of the new application or database. Then the final step is to load it
into the new system.

## Types of Data Migrations and Their Challenges

Data migration processes happen on three levels -- storage, database and
application.

### Storage migration

When you do a technology refresh, this is the time to identify obsolete
data to reduce storage space and make it easier to quickly find
what you're looking for. We use a
variety of storage migration tools to make this process fast and simple.
However, what we can't do is tell
you what's important to keep and what can be discarded.
You have to decide
that. We'll ask you questions
like:

-   How many documents do you have with names like
    brochure-final4.docx? Do you need to keep the prior versions for any
    reason?
-   Why you have the same content in more than one location? Is it for
    cloud backup? Or are you working around security settings in your
    systems to make the content available to different
    audiences?
-   What is this obsolete content costing you? For example, video files
    take up a significant amount of space. While storage is relatively
    cheap, employee time is not. When you add up time spent dealing with
    system performance issues, organizing clutter, and looking for the
    right content, the overhead costs can become
    significant.

### Database migration

A database migration occurs whenever you change database vendors,
upgrade the database software, or move a database to the cloud. In a
database migration, IT professionals look for compatibility issues. Is
there enough storage? Will performance be impacted? How do we protect
records that require privacy or security? Are there integration points
that can fail? Often, a database migration or upgrade is done in a
testing environment before being moved to production.

### Application migration

An application migration is the most complex type of migration. The
challenge is that each application has its own data
model, so the data may have to be significantly
manipulated before being brought into the new
application.

You want to think about the ramifications of keeping -- or discarding
-- old records and historical data. For example, in an accounting
system, you can start with an account opening balance or you can import
every transaction. In a CRM system, you may want to purge anyone
you haven't talked to in a year.
We help clients figure out the best application migration strategy for
their
situation.

-   Will you have to keep the old system running in parallel -- just in
    case? Could you transfer the data to a spreadsheet instead? Do you
    have compliance requirements you must adhere
    to?
-   What is the value of that data? A company that sells SAT
    preparation tests to high schoolers has a
    finite time period to sell
    their solution. There's no
    point in keeping a record of who was in high school 5 years ago. But
    a repair company may have a 5-10
    year lifecycle between visits, and want to keep
    those
    records.
-   How much does it cost to keep this data? Some applications, like
    email marketing software, charge by the record. Crossing from 4999
    contacts to 5000 may cause the price to spike. If 2000 of those
    people haven't opened your
    emails in 3 years, you're better off deleting them in the move to a
    new
    application.
-   Will system speed be impacted? How many users need to access that
    historical data or that legacy software feature? Can the old
    solution be
    retired?

## Data Migration Tools

The advantage of using IT professionals for your data migration is that
we have access to a variety of tools to make the process faster and
easier. If we can't find a tool
out of the box, we can sometimes build a
script to make the
ETL work easier. It depends on the
scope and scale of the migration project, but in all cases, we look for
ways to simplify and automate the process wherever
possible.

In many cases, the software vendor has tools we can
leverage. Here's one example of
what Microsoft makes available for clients wanting to transfer hosting
to the Azure platform:

## Our Approach to the Migration Process

With the implementation of any new software, or development of any new
database or
application, we'll discuss how to
manage your legacy data and find an approach that best fits your
business. In our
planning, we'll work with you to
determine whether the data migration is a one-time data transfer process
or requires ongoing [data integration](/software/why-have-integrated-business-software) and
management.

[We'll look for ways to simplify your IT environment,
seeing if we can consolidate databases, and make sure employees can
access your systems from any device, especially when they're not working
on premises. In today's environment, mobility and remote access is a
requirement for any new
system. That's why many companies
are [moving to the cloud.](/it-services/cloud-migration)
