## Microsoft Word features

Unlock the full potential of your documents using Microsoft Word’s powerful features. Ensure consistent formatting with Styles, maintain a cohesive look across documents with Themes, and save time with Templates.

## 1\. Using Microsoft Word styles

Styles in Microsoft Word make it easy to apply uniform formatting throughout your document. Instead of adjusting headings individually, apply a Style to update all headings instantly. Access Styles from the Home Tab, and modify them to suit your needs.

For example in this document, when select the "Title" text then apply the Title Style, the document formatting will be updated.

From the Home Tab

Continue to Select Text and Apply the Heading Style

Header 1

Header 2

Header 3

### What if you want a different style?

![Apply different styles in Microsoft Word](/images/post/word-styles-change-style.jpg)

Go to the Design Tab

Microsoft Word offers a number of pre-built Styles.

Clicking on the Style will change the formatting throughout your document.

Still on the Design Tab

![Choose Microsoft Word Colors and Fonts](/images/post/word-styles-adjust-style.jpg)

You can also choose your Document Colors, Fonts, and Other Items.

You can even Customize Your Options

![Customize Microsoft Word Fonts](/images/post/word-styles-customize-fonts.jpg)

Your Font and Color combinations are not restricted to Microsoft Word's pre-built options. At the bottom, you can create your own combination and give it a custom name that you'll remember.

### What if you can't find a style that works?

Once you've selected the Styles, Fonts, and Colors you like best in the Design tab, head back to the Home tab.

You can further customize your Style options by "right-clicking" any Style.

Select Modify

![Modify style](/images/post/word-styles-modify.jpg)

This will modify every Style Element across your document.

Click on "Format" menu

![Format style](/images/post/word-styles-format-style.jpg)

See even more editing choices.

Choose Between Saving Styles in the Document and Template

![Choices on how to save Microsoft Word Styles](/images/post/word-styles-only-in-document.jpg)

You can save these settings to be consistent across this document ONLY, or you can save it in the Template, so that all future documents will have this same "look and feel."

## 2\. Using Microsoft Word themes

![Microsoft Word Themes](/images/post/word-themes-save-theme.jpg)

If you want to use these set Styles again and again, you can save them as a Custom Theme.

A Theme saves the "look and feel" of the document.

A Template uses the Theme "look" but also adds text that you may want to use again and again.

### The next time you open a document…

![MS Word Theme](/images/post/word-themes-select-custom-theme.jpg)

Under the Design Tab, you will now see the Custom "New Theme" you created.

## 3\. Using Microsoft Word templates

### Create your document

![Microsoft Word Templates](/images/post/word-templates-letterhead.jpg)

You create a Template exactly the same way you create any document.  The only difference is how you Save.

Save Your Template

![Microsoft Word Templates](/images/post/word-templates-save-templates.jpg)

Save your document as a Template. Use the folder where Microsoft Word prompts you to save it.

Using Templates

![Microsoft Word Template](/images/post/word-templates-new-from-template.jpg)

Use Templates when you want to save the document text, in addition to the Theme.

Once you have saved a Template, you can find it on your New screen when you create a New Document.
