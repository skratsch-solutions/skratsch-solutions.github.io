## Considering moving to Microsoft 365?

Microsoft 365 is the productivity platform once called Office 365. As a Microsoft Partner, we help you make the most of your technology investment. Our IT Professionals will help you:

* Select the appropriate Microsoft 365 licenses. You don't want to pay too much - or not get the features you need. While the Microsoft website has a lot of information, our team can get your questions answered more quickly and more thoroughly.
* Create the account. Setup initial users, permissions and mailboxes. We'll help you understand your options around security and shared resources, mailboxes, teams and groups.
* Sync your Microsoft accounts. If you have an on-premise Active Directory, we can setup user synchronization with Microsoft 365.
* Move your emails and data from other systems into the Microsoft Cloud. Whether you're moving from an on-premise Exchange Server or G-Suite, your old mailboxes and file servers can be moved over so everything can be accessed from one central location.
  * Setup storage, security and archiving rules.
  * Setup rules for automatic email encryption.
  * Establish secure connections between mail servers.
  * Create forwarding rules.
  * Enable litigation holds when necessary to preserve email in case of legal action.
  * Help manage HIPAA or other privacy compliance concerns.
  * Decide on anti-malware, backup and other data security needs.

Let our technology experts support your business systems, troubleshoot problems, and help your team use technology to your advantage.
