## Choosing Between Application Hosting and SaaS Solutions

In today's tech landscape, most business applications lean toward SaaS (software-as-a-service) models. With SaaS, you pay a recurring fee for a vendor-hosted application. The perks? Lower upfront costs, remote accessibility, and automatic updates managed by the vendor.

Now, let's talk about application hosting. By migrating apps to the cloud, you can provide desktop software via the Internet. Our application hosting services handle architecture and administration.

Consider application hosting when:

1. **Software Ownership**: You already own the license and want to avoid monthly subscriptions.
2. **Remote Access**: You need to make a desktop app available to remote users.
3. **Unique Software**: The software isn't offered as a SaaS subscription.
4. **Value-Added Services**: You want to offer hosting as a perk or revenue stream. For instance, accountants use hosted QuickBooks Desktop for advanced features beyond QuickBooks Online.

Choose wiselyâ€”it's all about finding the right fit for your business!
