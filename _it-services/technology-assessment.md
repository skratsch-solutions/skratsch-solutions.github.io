## Uncover Opportunities and Mitigate Risk with a Business Technology Assessment

At Skratsch Solutions, we offer a **free online IT self-assessment** to help you gauge the health of your business technology. Additionally, feel free to reach out for a complimentary consultation. However, it's common for our clients to **assume** their systems are efficient and secure, only to discover gaps. That's why booking a business technology assessment is valuableâ€”it provides an independent evaluation by our IT professionals.

A business technology assessment is an **affordable and straightforward** way to gain insights into your technology landscape. Our assessments start at just $500. During this process, a Skratsch Solutions IT professional will review:

- Your current technology and business challenges
- Hardware (servers, desktops, laptops)
- Infrastructure software (operating system, email, file storage)
- Productivity and line-of-business software
- Data security tools
- IT policies and procedures

Upon completion, we'll deliver a comprehensive Business Technology Assessment Report with actionable recommendations. Given the ever-evolving nature of technology and business, we recommend scheduling an IT assessment every 3-4 years. Whether you use our findings to shape your IT roadmap or simply gain peace of mind, rest assured that your systems are secure.
