## Find opportunities and reduce risk with a business technology assessment

We offer a [free online IT self-assessment](/assessment) for you to gauge the health of your business technology. And of course, you can always call us for a free consultation. But often, we find our clients THINK their systems are efficient and secure, but they're not. That's why it's worth it to book a business technology assessment to get an independent opinion from our IT professionals.

A business technology assessment is an easy, affordable way to understand what's going on with your business technology. These technology assessments start as low as $500. An Eclipse Consulting IT professional will review your IT environment for risks and opportunities. We will look at:

* Your current technology and business challenges
* Hardware - servers, desktops, laptops
* Infrastructure software - operation system, email, file storage
* Productivity/line of business software
* Data security tools
* IT policies & procedures

We'll wrap up this short project by delivering an Business Technology Assessment Report with our recommendations. Because technology and business are both constantly evolving, we recommend you get an IT assessment every 3-4 years. You can use our findings as the start of your IT roadmap - or maybe you'll just sleep better knowing your systems are secure.
