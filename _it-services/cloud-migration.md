## Cloud migration services

We can migrate your desktop applications to secure cloud infrastructure environment, so that they are widely available to users through an internet connection. Companies frequently choose cloud migration because they don't want to buy or maintain on-premise servers. Instead of having an upfront capital expense, cloud servers become part of your operational costs. We can help move your data by:

* Recommending the right hosting platform - AWS, Azure or Google Cloud
* Ensuring application and environment compatibility
* Onboarding users and setting up security roles
* Importing data

Once we're finished with the cloud migration, we turn the keys over to you to manage the environment. If you'd like us to manage and maintain your cloud environment, ask about our application hosting services instead.
