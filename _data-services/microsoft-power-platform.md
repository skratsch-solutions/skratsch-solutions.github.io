## Use the Microsoft Power Platform to streamline operations

The Microsoft Power Platform consists of five products that can be used individually or together to connect applications to create an end-to-end business workflow.

While Microsoft touts these products as making it “easy for everyone to build their own custom solutions,” we find many of our clients have neither the time or interest in learning how to join database fields and build their own applications.

We have deep understanding of databases and how to build custom queries – and custom applications – so you can get the exact solution that fits the needs of your organization. Out of the box, Power Platform connects with hundreds of applications. Let us see what we can build for you.

## Microsoft Power Platform Consists Of

- **Power BI** To visualize data
- **Power Apps** A low-code app-building solution
- **Power Pages** A low-code data-driven website portal for customers and employees
- **Power Automate** Sends data automatically from one app to another 
- **Power Virtual Agents** A low-code chatbot solution

## Power Apps & Power Automate

As software developers, our team often faces requests to create new applications or replace existing ones. Power Apps proves valuable for various projects, including:

- **Access Database Replacement:** When migrating away from an Access database, Power Apps offers a robust alternative.
- **Front-End Forms:** We can build mobile-friendly inspection checklists that centralize data using Power Apps.
- **System Integration:** Power Apps facilitates seamless data transfer between order-taking systems and accounting platforms.

## Why many customers prefer Power Apps over other solutions:

1. **Seamless Integration:** Power Apps natively connects with other Microsoft applications.
2. **Continuous Improvement:** Microsoft consistently enhances Power Apps.
3. **Robust Security and Compliance:** Power Apps offers strong security features.
4. **Cost-Effective and Efficient:** It's a faster and more affordable alternative to traditional custom-coded applications.
