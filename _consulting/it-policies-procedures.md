## Creating IT policies and procedures for your business

IT policies and procedures exist to improve operational efficiency and reduce risk. We can help you figure out the policies and procedures you need to keep your business running smoothly. Together, we can walk through scenarios like:

- Onboarding and offboarding employees and contractors
- What steps to take immediately when an employee is terminated
- Authorization procedures for buying computer equipment
- How to curtail activities like personal social media and online shopping
- Steps for responding to sales and support inquiries

As your IT partner, we want to help you develop policies and procedures that are pragmatic and enforceable. But of course, you should also consult with attorneys and HR professionals.

## IT procedures create efficiency

Don't make employees guess how to do their jobs. Small business software is designed to enable employee empowerment and increase customer satisfaction. Creating technology checklists and offering your employees technology training will help you create consistency and build trust, plus will save you time, money and frustration.

## Enforcing IT policies increases data security

Most security breaches are caused by employees. Most data loss is caused by poorly enforced IT policies.
